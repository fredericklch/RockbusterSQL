Here is a SQL query with a common table expression to find the average:

SELECT AVG(total_paid) as average
FROM
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(E.amount) AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE country IN ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia')
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5
ORDER BY total_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid


Here is another SQL query with common table expression to find the top customer count in top 10 countries with most customers:

SELECT D.country,
COUNT (DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN 
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(E.amount) AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE country IN ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia')
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5
ORDER BY total_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) top_5_customers ON A.customer_id = top_5_customers.customer_id
GROUP by D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10
