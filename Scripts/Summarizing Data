Here is a SQL query to find the basic statistics:

SELECT 
MIN(rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration,
MAX (rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration,
AVG (rental_duration) AS avg_rental_duration
FROM film


Here is another SQL query to find the Mode: 

SELECT MODE () WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating)
       AS modal_value
FROM film
