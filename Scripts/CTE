Here is a SQL query with a common table expression to find the average:

WITH total_paid_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_paid) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(E.amount) AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE country IN ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia')
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5
ORDER BY total_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_paid) as average
FROM total_paid_cte


Here is another SQL query with common table expression to find the top customer count in top 10 countries with most customers:

WITH total_paid_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_paid) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(E.amount) AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE country IN ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia')
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5
ORDER BY total_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country,
COUNT (DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(total_paid_cte) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN total_paid_CTE ON A.customer_id = total_paid_cte.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10
