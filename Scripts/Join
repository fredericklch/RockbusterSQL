Here is a SQL query with a join to find the top 10 countries with most customers:

SELECT D.country,
       COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM customer A
LEFT JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
LEFT JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
LEFT JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_customers DESC
LIMIT 10


Here is another SQL query with join to find the top customer count in top 10 countries with most customers:

SELECT C.city,
       COUNT(customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM customer A
LEFT JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
LEFT JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
LEFT JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE country IN('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia')
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY total_customers DESC


Here is a SQL query with inner join to find the top 5 customers (with most expenditure) within the top 10 countries:

(SELECT
A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(E.amount) AS total_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY A.customer_id,A.first_name,A.last_name,C.city,D.country
HAVING country IN ('India','China','United States','Japan','Mexico','Brazil','Russian Federation','Philippines','Turkey','Indonesia')
ORDER BY total_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
